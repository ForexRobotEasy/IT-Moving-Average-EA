## Product Description

The IT Moving Average EA is a forex trading robot that uses two moving averages to determine trading signals. It trades based on the crossover of the two moving averages. When the shorter-term moving average crosses above the longer-term moving average, a buy signal is generated. Conversely, when the shorter-term moving average crosses below the longer-term moving average, a sell signal is generated.

### Features

- Customizable moving average periods: The EA allows you to define the periods for the two moving averages. By default, the first moving average has a period of 50, and the second moving average has a period of 200. However, you can modify these values according to your trading strategy.

- Full trading mode: The EA enables full trading mode, which means it can open, close, and modify positions on the trading account.

- Automatic position management: The EA checks for existing positions before opening new ones. If a buy position exists and a buy signal is generated, the EA closes the existing position before opening a new one. The same process applies to sell positions.

- Dynamic lot size: The EA uses a fixed lot size of 0.01 for each order. You can adjust this value to suit your risk management preferences.
